# Traffic Sign Segmentation and Classification
## ML Final Project CS451
### Ben Vandenbosch and Henry Mound

In order for this code to run, the user must have Pillow, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to run. 
create_dataset.py reads from the LISA dataset which can be downloaded [here](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html).
In order for the code to run, the signDatabasePublicFramesOnly should be in the root directory. 



To Do:
1. Watching CNN videos: http://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~schar/courses/cs451-f18/prep/p31.html
2. Read TensorFlow tutorial completely: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimators/cnn
3. Look for more traffic sign data
